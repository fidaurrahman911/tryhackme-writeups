Objective  
To complete the TryHackMe “Cryptography Basics” module and understand the core ideas behind encryption, decryption, and how cryptography protects data in cybersecurity.  

Summary of what I did  
I completed the full Cryptography Basics learning module on TryHackMe. I learned how data can be kept secret using encryption techniques, and how information can only be read by authorized users who have the correct key.  
The lesson explained the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption, common algorithms, and how XOR math is used in simple encryption examples. I also reviewed real-world uses of cryptography such as SSL/TLS, hashing, and digital signatures.  

Practical commands / concepts I reviewed (in my Kali environment)  
- Practiced XOR encryption manually using small binary and ASCII examples to understand bitwise operations.  
- Reviewed how public and private keys are generated in asymmetric encryption.  
- Observed examples of Caesar cipher and how shifting letters can encode messages.  
- Learned how hashing algorithms (like MD5 and SHA256) generate fixed-length fingerprints of data.  

Key takeaways  
- **Symmetric encryption** uses one shared key for both encryption and decryption (fast but less secure for sharing).  
- **Asymmetric encryption** uses two keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption (used in secure communication like HTTPS).  
- XOR is a simple mathematical operation used in many cryptographic functions.  
- Cryptography ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authentication in modern systems.  

Tools used  
TryHackMe learning environment (web)  
Kali Linux terminal for practicing XOR and hashing examples.  

Note  
This module helped me understand the mathematical and logical foundations of encryption. I will apply this knowledge later when using tools such as GPG, OpenSSL, and Wireshark in future labs.
